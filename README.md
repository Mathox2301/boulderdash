# ATLG 2022 Project: Boulderdash

## Presentation:
This application is a game called BoulderDash. We chose the 1984 version as our model.
It includes:

* The application
* Level files
* Images representing the various game elements
* A font
* A file containing a program structure in class diagrams (one in png format and the other with a link, but they are the same)

## Objective:
The goal of the game is to collect a certain number of diamonds without being crushed by them or by the rocks that may be in your way.

## Controls:
Use the keys Z, Q, S, D, or the arrow keys to move the player. Use U to undo a move and R to redo an undone move. Press L to abandon the game.

## My Choices:
Here are the different choices I made regarding the game's behavior and rendering:

* I chose not to create a menu to select levels but to progress through them in order (from level 1 to the last available).
* I also decided to make the exit inaccessible until the player has collected at least 1/4 of the diamonds present in the level.
